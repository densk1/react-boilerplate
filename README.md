# react-boilerplate
### A boilerplate for react projects setup with a redux store and using bootstrap


#### To do
1. Currently the project uses `reactstrap`. It needs to be re-configured to use standard HTML tags and `Bootstrap` classes. reactstrap while convenient in some cases is generally prohibitive to agile styling.

2. Addition of fetch when a user is logging in.
